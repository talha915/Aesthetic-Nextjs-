                        <p>You and Aesthetic Record agree that any claim or dispute at law or equity that has arisen, ormay arise, between you and Aesthetic Record (including any claim or dispute between youand a third-party agent of Aesthetic Record) that relates in any way to or arises out of this orprevious versions of this Agreement, your use of or access to the Services, the actions ofAesthetic Record (and its agents, officers, directors, and employees) or any products orservices sold or purchased through the Services, will be resolved in accordance with theprovisions set forth in this Legal Disputes Section.</p>
                        <p><strong>1. Applicable law.</strong>  You agree that, except to the extent inconsistent with or preempted byfederal law, the laws of the State of Ohio, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, willgovern this Agreement and any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you andAesthetic Record, except as otherwise stated in this Agreement. </p>
                        <p><strong>2. Agreement to Arbitrate.</strong> You and Aesthetic Record each agree that any and alldisputes or claims that have arisen, or may arise, between you and Aesthetic Record(including any disputes or claims between you and a third-party agent of Aesthetic Record)that relate in any way to or arise out of this or previous versions of this Agreement, youruse of or access to the Services, the actions of Aesthetic Record (and its agents, officers,directors, and employees), or any products or services sold, offered, or purchased throughthe Services shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather thanin court. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.</p>
                        <p><strong>i. Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-individualized Relief.</strong></p>
                        <p>YOU AND AESTHETIC RECORD AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAYBRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, OR REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU ANDAESTHETIC  AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR  MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'SCLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED,   REPRESENTATIVE,   CLASS,   OR   PRIVATE ATTORNEY   GENERAL   ACTION   OR   PROCEEDING.

ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER USERS.  If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court, subject to your and Aesthetic Record's right to appeal the court's decision. All other claims will be arbitrated.</p>
                        <p><strong>ii. Arbitration Procedures </strong> </p>
                        <p>Arbitration is more informal than a law suit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award isvery limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual.  An arbitrator should apply the terms of the Agreement as a court would.   All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, or the interpretation of Section (i) of this Agreement to Arbitrate ("Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions andNon-Individualized Relief"), shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide. </p>
                        <p>The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association("AAA") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The use of the word "arbitrator" in this provision shall not be construed to prohibit more than one arbitrator from presiding over an arbitration; rather, the AAA's rules will govern the number of arbitrators that may preside over an arbitration conducted under this Agreement to Arbitrate.</p>
                        <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a letter requesting arbitration, describing the nature and basis of your claim,and the relief sought. The Notice to Aesthetic Record should be sent via certified mail to Aesthetic Record, Attn: Tiphany Lopez, Re: Arbitration Request, 40 WestGay Street, Columbus, OH 43215.   Aesthetic Record will send any letter requesting arbitration to your business or employer address we have on file associated with your Account; it is your responsibility to keep your address up to date.  </p>
                        <p>If you and Aesthetic Record are unable to resolve the claims described in the letter requesting arbitration within 30 days after the letter is sent, you or Aesthetic Record may initiate arbitration proceedings.   A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's site at www.adr.org.  In addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, the party initiating the arbitration must mail a copy of the completed form to the opposing party. You shall also send a copy to Aesthetic Record via certified mail to the following address: Aesthetic Record, Attn: Tiphany Lopez, Re: Arbitration Request, 40 West Gay Street, Columbus, OH 43215.

Any settlement offer made by you or Aesthetic Record shall not bedis closed to the arbitrator.</p>
                        <p>The arbitration hearing shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location.  If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or Aesthetic Record may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and Aesthetic Record subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant.  In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or Aesthetic record may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise. The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law.</p>
                        <p>The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same Aesthetic Record user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and judgmenton the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction there of.</p>
                        <p><strong>iii. Costs of Arbitration </strong></p>
                        <p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by theAAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate.  If the valueof the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, Aesthetic Record will payall filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration.  Anyrequest for payment of fees by Aesthetic Record should be submitted by mail tothe AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and Aesthetic Record will makearrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA.  In the event thearbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, youagree to reimburse Aesthetic Record for all fees associated with the arbitrationpaid by Aesthetic Record on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated topay under the AAA's rules.</p>
                        <p>iv. Severability</p>
                        <p>With the exception of any of the provisions in Section (i) of this Agreement toArbitrate   ("Prohibition   of   Class   and   Representative   Actions   and   Non-Individualized Relief"), if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply.</p>

                        <p>Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you andAesthetic Record agree that if we make any amendment to this Agreement toArbitrate (other than an amendment to any notice address) in the future, thatamendment shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceedingagainst Aesthetic Record prior to the effective date of the amendment.
